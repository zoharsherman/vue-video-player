'我们这里是建行,只有建房子才能到这里取钱。你取钱买吃的,那肯定是粮食了,要去农行,买穿的等东西,取钱要到工商银行才行！' <br _v-76371ce9=\\\"\\\"> 我同学打心眼里佩服呀,到底是当主管的啊!!!! <br _v-76371ce9=\\\"\\\"><br _v-76371ce9=\\\"\\\"> ………… <br _v-76371ce9=\\\"\\\"> …………

      果然,保安对该女子说:'你这张条子想要提款,必须先到对面派出所,找所长盖一个章，他盖完章,你再来取钱就没问题啦。' <br>\n        该女子想都没想，直接就向派出所走去了。(这保安还真不一般,平时有点小看他了). <br><br>\n        大概十多分钟，排队的顾客慢慢多起来的时候，那个女子兴高采烈的回来了，举着那个条子，说：'人家说啦，办公程序简化了，不用所长批条直接就可以取钱啦。' <br><br>\n        我这个同学一听到这就不住的感叹:pol.ice队伍里真有高人，一句'高调'就给打发回来了。 <br><br>\n        我这个同学和保安当时就有点傻了，营业大厅有很多人都在，怕她精神病发作起来影响正常的秩序，只好把值班主管找来了。 <br><br>\n        主管和女患者在一边聊了几句，问你取钱做什么用呀,女患者说:'取钱买面包,蛋糕,吃的,买穿的'主管指了指不远处的地方，该女子就又高高兴兴地走了。 <br>\n        保安去请教'高招',主管当时是这样对女患者说的: '我们这里是建行,只有建房子才能到这里取钱。你取钱买吃的,那肯定是粮食了,要去农行,买穿的等东西,取钱要到工商银行才行！' <br>\n        我同学打心眼里佩服呀,到底是当主管的啊!!!! <br><br>\n        ………… <br>\n        ………… <br>\n        过了一会儿,该女士又回来了.而且带来了工行的回答:'农行的人说了,这里是农行,只有农民能取钱,我是城市人口,工行的人说了,我们这里是公行,只能公的来取,母的不行!!!!,说我是贱人,要到建行取钱' </p>\n      </swiper-slide>\n      <div class=\"swiper-scrollbar\" solt=\"scrollbar\"></div>\n
